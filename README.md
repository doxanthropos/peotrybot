# peotrybot
Here I am going to build a little bot that toots generated poetry.

## Tokens

If you want to use this bot or a fork, you will need tokens for the bot account, you want to use.
These are the client_key, the client_secret and the access_token.
To make sure that they are not shared on a public repo, this repo does not contain these tokens, but only an example file, that you can use.

This bot expects these tokens to be in a file called tokens.js in the bots root directory. You can make a copy of the file example_tokens.js, call it tokens.js and enter your own tokens. If you do not change the gitignore file, this token file will not be part of your repo and therefore not shared.
